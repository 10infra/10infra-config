# 10infra-config

`10infra-config` is a prototype of a pull-based configuration system. Think of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), but
instead of pushing config from one machine to n-others, the others run an agent that pulls the config from a centralized
repo. Kinda like [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/), but hopefully a bit more modern!

The dream is for this project to configure some bare-metal machines around the world! 

The code is (and will be for some good time) disorderly and in continuous evolution. 
I work on this project in my free time so it may take uncountable days before it is in any ready/usable state. 
Also commits may get squashed from time to time to clean up WIPs.

For the moment, if you want to support me, you can buy me an espresso on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/cmaster11)!
