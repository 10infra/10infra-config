# 10infra-config

`10infra-config` is a prototype of a pull-based configuration system. Think of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), but
instead of pushing config from one machine to n-others, the others run an agent that pulls the config from a centralized
repo.

The dream is for this project to configure some bare-metal machines around the world!
